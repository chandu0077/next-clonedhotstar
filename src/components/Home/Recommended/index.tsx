            We established our company with a goal to provide the public with
            high-quality voice-over of both world-known movies and small
            projects. Furthermore, we aimed to replace common TV. Not long ago,
            it was impossible to watch a foreign movie with a voice-over in your
            native language on the same day it was released, since localization
            took a very long time, from several months to a year. And when the
            movie finally appeared on the TV screens, one had to keep the
            broadcasting schedule in mind. This is no longer an issue thanks to
            Saicord. Any person can now watch a movie they want at a convenient
            time and with a pleasant voice-over.

            The studio developing, the speed of our work has also increased.
            Thus, we have achieved excellent results. Telugu voice-overs of
            foreign movie and TV series are released on the premiere day. Such a
            large amount of work and high speed could have damaged the quality
            of translation and voice acting, but that does not apply to us. Our
            users have been happy with our platform for several years.
            Voice-overs where all the actors are voiced by one person are not
            uncommon. Again, that is not the case with Saicord, as we choose a
            separate person for the voice-over of each character and make sure
            that the voice acting style matches the character of a movie or TV
            series best. Thanks to the fact that we are constantly expanding our
            staff, our users have a wide selection of TV series, movies and TV
            shows in Telugu voice acting.
